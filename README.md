Michael Jacksonâ€“themed memory game via Code Sketch tutorial
This is from Marina Ferreira's "Memory Game in Vanilla JavaScript" tutorial (https://medium.freecodecamp.org/vanilla-javascript-tutorial-build-a-memory-game-in-30-minutes-e542c4447eae, https://youtu.be/eMhiMsEC9Uk). I enjoyed this project because it taught me things that I'd seen and used before (e.g., ternary, flex) but in a different context. Also didn't hurt that I customized it to be about one of my favorite entertainers, Michael Jackson.
